Configured script to use/set the default hyper-v VM storage locations instead of resetting to Hyper-V defaults.

Changed PowerShell console title to reflect version of script being run.

Added differencing disk capabilities. When differencing disks are used:
	The location for the differencing disk's master disk is added to the VM notes. 
	A readme file is also created with the master disk listing VMs who have differencing disks based on the master disk. 
	An OOBE snapshot is taken before the VM is started the first time.
